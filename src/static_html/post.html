                    Never in all their history have men been able truly to
                    conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having
                    the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the
                    directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
                    because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which
                    all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make
                    it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                    Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for
                    both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science.
                    The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
                    science.

                    What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that
                    man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

                    A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl
                    who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than
                    her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the
                    first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

                    For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the
                    hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience
                    most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we
                    share in our world are far more valuable than those which
                    divide us.

                    There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the
                    stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to
                    occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one
                    makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

                    Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any
                    one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process
                    which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural
                    laws of human development.

                    As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished
                    in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
                    beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object
                    looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a
                    finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to
                    change a man.

                    Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the
                    Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange
                    new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to
                    boldly go where no man has gone before.

                    As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I

                    must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
